	    As of sprint 1, you should do the following:
	    When you choose \"Take a Picture\", for best results you should set the resolution 
	    to 640x480 and take the picture in landscape\/horizontal mode.\n\n
	    When you choose \"Import a Picture\", if you are having problems, please insure the 
	    image is 640x480 and was taken in landscape mode.  We recommend using pictures out
	    of the \"SketchPlay\" folder that is created when you take a picture with our app.\n\n
	    When you have the image you want, press the \"Continue\" button.\n\n
	    Adjust the \"Saturation\" and \"Value\" sliders until the image displays as desired.\n
	    Saturation affects the intensity of colors.\n
	    Value affects the brightness of colors.\n\n
	    
	    When you\'re ready, click \"Play Game\"\n\n
	    
	    The arrow keys in the bottom left control left\/right movement, and the 
	    key in the bottom right is used to jump.  At present, there is no objective.\n\n
